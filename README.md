## General Information
I utilized three datasets for this project: directory, drink menu and food menu.  The data consisted of the nutritional information for both food and drink and the locations and store information of the Starbucks around the world.  Using Python dictionaries, regular expressions and data cleaning, I created five dataframes: full meny, coffee, tea, non-coffee/tea, food menu and locations that only reflects the US locations.  Included are plots for the ownership types and the map plot results through GeoApify. The dataframes were converted to csv files, imported to Postgresql and reloaded with SqlAlchemy.
